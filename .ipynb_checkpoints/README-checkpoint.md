# IBM-Statistics-for-Data-Science

This is the final project for the [Statistics for Data Science Course by IBM](
https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistics-for-data-science-python) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)

## Project Overview

Statistics is an integral part in obtaining and communicating insights in Data Science. As part of a course focused on the Statistics used in Data Science, this final project aims to evaluate the learner's understanding of statistical concepts and their implementation in Python. The project uses Numpy, Pandas, Statsmodels and Scipy for data wrangling, whereas Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization.

The data used is the [Boston Housing Dataset](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-ST0151EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/boston_housing.csv') with 12 Features and 506 observations.
